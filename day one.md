# GIT and GITHUB

# GIT: 
is a version control system or tool.  simply, a system to manage your files.


# GITHUB:
is a website/server which your git is hosted on.
your file will be saved in folder called " REPOSITORY."
# all steps 
Git commands
# For FIRST TIME
Method #1
● cd Desktop
● mkdir gtst && cd gtst
● git init
● git conﬁg –-global user.name <Your username>
● git conﬁg –-global user.email <Youremail>
# FOR NORMAL WORKS
● git status
● git add .
● git commit -m ‘<Your Comment>’ #you can
check it now
● git log
# FOR GITHUB
● git remote add origin <repositoryURL>
● git push -u origin master
● git clone <your project link>

# step one explanation 
1. cd ( change directory) Desktop: wede desktop endihedelen 

2. mkdir gtst && gtst: Desktopachn ly gtst yemibal folder make yaregilinal
3. git init: gtst foldern initialize yaregininal so here version control yijemral. 
4. git config --global user .name  geeztech0:( username): make yetedergew github ena git'achinin connect lemareg.
5. git config --global user .email tech10geez@gmail.com: this is the final stage esum git'achinin initialize ena link argo yicherisilinal.
 I do this all steps only on the first time. kezi bewhuala note metsaf nw cause purpose'achn note silehone.

I can take my notes every way eg. notepad , word.. etc but save as bilen file namun sinasgeba at the end ".md" masgebat and prefer file type from text document to all file.     this is must. while I do this all thing I don't have to cloth the git just minimize it.

Step 2: Check the
status
git commit will show you if any change have taken place in this repository.

# Introduction to Ethical Haching


# Hacking 
-is referred to exploiting system vulnerabilities
and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized
access to the system.

#Types of hackers based on >Ethics

1. White Hat Hackers: Ethical hackers who protect and secure systems.
- the helping and Good Peoples.
2. Black Hat Hackers: Malicious hackers who exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain.
- the most evil and bad peoples.
2. Gray Hat Hackers: In-between ethicality, hack without permission but with no malicious intent.
- the middle mans ,Good sometimes bad thinking
Peoples

# Types of hackers based on >Skill

1. Newbie / Noob
➔ Don’t have any knowledge
about hacking.

2. Script Kiddie
 ➔ A script kiddie, skiddie,
kiddie, or skid is a relatively
unskilled individual who
uses scripts or programs
developed by others,
primarily for malicious
purposes

3. Hacker
➔ Perfectly skilled, with less
experience

4. Elite/Pro Hacker
➔ Perfectly skilled, with Much
more experience


# Why do we learn hacking??
1. To prevent hackers from gaining access
2. To uncover vulnerabilities
3. To strengthen the organization
4. To safeguard the data
5. To avoid security Breaches
6. To enhance security awareness
7. To make money




★ ATTACKS = MOTIVE(GOAL) + METHOD +
VULNERABILITY

# Elements of Information security

CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. 

*Confidentiality*: Protecting information from unauthorized access.

*Integrity*: Ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of data. And the information is safe from accidental or intentional modification or alteration.

*Availability*: Ensuring information and systems are accessible when needed.

# Skills we need to be hacker
★ Programming
★ Networking
★ Linux
★ System admin



# Phases of Hacking
1. Reconnaissance - የዳሰሳ ጥናት :Gathering information about the target system or network.
2. Scanning - መቃኘት :Identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the target system.
3. Gaining Access -መዳረሻ ማግኘት :Exploiting the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
4. Maintaining Access  :Ensuring continuous access to the compromised system or network
5. Clearing Tracks or Logs - ትራኮችን ወይም መዝገቦችን ማጽዳት    : Removing evidence of the hacking activity to avoid detection.






# *Penetration Testing*

'★ Penetration Testing is a method of evaluating
the security of an information system or
network by simulating an attack to'
★ ﬁnd vulnerability
★ Security Measures
★ Documentation and Report Preparation


# Why we need Penetration Testing?
★ Identiﬁcation of threats
★ Security Protections and controls
★ Assessment of Organization's Security
★ Evaluation of Network Security
★ Upgradation of Infrastructure.


# Types of Pentesting

Types of Pentesting:

1. Black Box Pentesting: Simulates an external attack with no prior knowledge of the system.
-You test as an attacker.

2. White Box Pentesting: Testing with full knowledge and access to the system.
- You test as an Developer.

1. Grey Box Pentesting: Limited knowledge and access to simulate an insider attack.

- You test as an User.



> Permission in Cyber Security: Obtaining authorized access or consent before engaging in any activities related to securing, testing, or assessing systems, networks, or data.

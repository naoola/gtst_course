     '*●Kernel is a
     code/program that used
     to meet your Software (applications)
     and Hardware (CPU, MEMORY, DEVICES). And
     allocate some
     resources.'

# History of Linux


**In 1969 a team led by computer scientists Ken
Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the first
version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer, which was chosen mainly because of Thompson's
familiarity with the system from his hobby work on
it
BUT IT WASN’T CHEAP AND OPEN-SOURCE
**Then Person called “LINUS TORVALDS” Created
the Linux kernel. And posted it online to make it
open-source**

**Richard Stallman announced the GNU project
in 1983 and cofounded the Free Software
Foundation in 1985.
GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIX
OS, But it was just software replacement not full
os {Examples: Bash,tar,emacs…} .
So GNU + LINUX will give the GNU/Linux OS.
The GNU Linux project was started to create a
Unix-like operating system created with source
code that could be copied, modified, and
redistributed.**

# What is Shell?

           Users communicate with the
             kernel by the shell.

The Shell: A command line interpreter that facilitates communication between users and the kernel. It takes user-entered commands, translates them into a language understood by the kernel.

Based on their features there are many shells.

          SH
          BASH
          ZSH
          FISH

# What is OS- Operating system??

**We have said UNIX and GNU/Linux as OS but what is OS. 
*OS is “operating system”, which means the main software part of computer that helps to work on.**


It contains:

         Kernel
         Softwares
         Desktop environment
         File extensions
         Window manager

short explanation of them:
   ' Kernel: The core component of an operating system that manages system resources and provides essential services to other software programs.'

      Software: Programs or applications designed to perform specific tasks on a computer system.

     Desktop Environment: A graphical interface that provides a cohesive and user-friendly environment for interacting with the operating system, including features like icons, menus, and windows.

    File Extensions: A suffix attached to a filename that indicates the type or format of the file. It helps the operating system and associated software identify and handle files correctly.

    Window Manager: Manages the appearance and behavior of windows in a graphical user interface. It controls how windows are displayed, moved, resized, and interacted with on the screen.'



Types of desktop environment on linux
       mate
       gnome
       KDE plasma
       XFCE
MATE: Moderate animation and graphics, good quality, balanced overall.

GNOME: Smooth animation and sleek graphics, high-quality visuals, modern design.

KDE Plasma: Rich animation and graphics, excellent quality, highly customizable.

XFCE: Limited animation and basic graphics, good quality for low-resource systems, lightweight design.

Considering factors such as animation, graphics, quality, and other preferences, each desktop environment has its strengths. GNOME and KDE Plasma offer more visually appealing and feature-rich experiences, while MATE and XFCE prioritize resource efficiency and simplicity. The choice ultimately depends on individual preferences and system requirements.

Linux distributions, or distros, are complete operating systems based on the Linux kernel, bundled with software packages, and tailored to different user needs and preferences.

Distro is Modiﬁed Linux Kernels,type of operating systems with different:
             - LINUX KERNEL
             - PACKAGES (GNU)
             - PACKAGE MANAGER
             - DESKTOP UI


 DEBIAN
      Kali linux
      Ubuntu
      Parrot
  ARCH
      Black
      Arch
      Garuda
  FEDORA
  RED HAT
  GENTOO
  ANDROID <

                  Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and Parrot are Linux distributions that are based on Debian. They are all separate operating systems that utilize the Debian framework and build upon its features and software.

Which is best for hackers?
● Kali linux
● Parrot Os
● Garuda
● Black Arch

# Do windows have distros?

    'No, Windows does not have distros. Unlike Linux, Windows is not open-source, which means that it is not freely accessible for users to modify or create different distributions based on it. Windows is developed and updated by Microsoft, who releases updates and adds new features to the operating system.'



# Methods of using Linux on computer

A. Main OS/ Main -boot
B. Dual -boot/ 2 in 1
C. Cloud terminals
D. Virtual machine
E. WSL v2/ Window Subsystem for Linux
F. Live -boot
G. Termux -Android


 'in more detail'
**A. Main OS/Main Boot: Installing Linux as the primary operating system on a computer allows users to fully dedicate their system to Linux. This setup provides complete control over hardware resources and maximizes performance. Users have the freedom to choose their preferred Linux distribution, customize the system to their liking, and have direct access to all available software and updates.


B. Dual Boot/2 in 1: Dual-booting involves installing Linux alongside another operating system, such as Windows, on the same computer. This configuration allows users to choose which operating system to boot into when starting their computer. Dual booting requires partitioning the hard drive to allocate space for each OS and typically involves a boot manager that presents a menu for OS selection during startup. It provides the flexibility of having both Linux and another OS available on a single machine, enabling users to switch between them based on their needs or preferences.

C. Cloud Terminals: Cloud terminals, also known as cloud-based Linux desktops, provide access to Linux environments remotely through cloud services. Users can connect to virtual machines or containers running Linux and perform tasks using a web browser or specialized client software. Cloud terminals offer the advantage of accessing Linux resources and applications from any device with an internet connection, eliminating the need for local installation. They are particularly useful for collaboration, remote work, or accessing Linux-based tools and environments on-demand.
![[Pasted image 20231022163826.png]]

D. Virtual Machine: Virtualization involves creating virtual instances of computers within an existing operating system. With virtual machines (VMs), users can run Linux alongside other operating systems on the same physical machine. Virtualization software, such as VirtualBox or VMware, provides the ability to allocate resources, install Linux distributions, and manage multiple VMs simultaneously. VMs offer sandboxed environments, allowing users to experiment, test software, run specific applications, or create isolated development environments without affecting the host operating system.

         'Computers have a Technology called
         “VIRTUALIZATION”. This is the
         method how it allocate our using
        memory to the virtual machines/ VM’s
        This is a method to use windows and
          linux together. 
'
You have to check some systems
          - Open task manager
          - Goto performance
          - open CPU
    
    If it is disables, you have
    to enable in BIOS
    settings

     If is is enabled we are
     good to go.

E. WSL v2/Windows Subsystem for Linux: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a compatibility layer in Windows 10 that enables the execution of Linux distributions natively on Windows. With WSL, users can run Linux command-line tools and utilities directly on their Windows system without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual-boot setup. WSL v2, the latest version, provides improved performance and full system call compatibility, offering a more seamless integration of Linux and Windows environments.

You can simply install them from Microsoft Store


![[Pasted image 20231022164539.png]]

F. Live Boot: Live booting involves running Linux directly from external media, such as a USB flash drive or DVD, without installing it on the computer's hard drive. Live boot media contains a complete Linux system that can be booted on compatible hardware. This method allows users to test and explore different Linux distributions without modifying their existing operating system. Live booting is often used for system recovery, troubleshooting, or as a portable Linux environment.

G. Termux (Android): Termux is an Android application that provides a Linux-like environment on Android devices. By installing Termux, users can access a command-line interface and run Linux utilities and packages on their Android device. Termux enables users to perform tasks such as programming, scripting, SSH connections, and running Linux tools directly on their mobile device. It offers a convenient way to experience Linux-like functionality on the Android platform, making it popular among developers and enthusiasts.
